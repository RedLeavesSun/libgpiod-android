libgpiod v0.3
=============

New features:
- gpiomon can now watch multiple lines at the same time and supports custom
  output formats which can be specified using the --format argument
- testing framework can now test external programs: test cases for gpio-tools
  have been added

Improvements:
- improve error messages
- improve README examples
- configure script improvements

Bug fixes:
- use correct UAPI flags when requesting line events

libgpiod v0.2.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- capitalize 'GPIO' in error messages in gpioset, gpioget & gpiomon
- tweak the error message on invalid arguments in gpiofind
- don't ignore superfluous arguments and fix the displayed name for falling
  edge events in gpiomon

libgpiod v0.2
=============

New features:
- relicensed under LGPLv2.1
- implemented a unit testing framework together with a comprehensive
  set of test cases
- added a non-closing variant of the gpiochip iterator and foreach
  macro [by Clemens Gruber]
- added gpiod_chip_open_by_label()

Improvements:
- Makefiles & build commands have been reworked [by Thierry Reding]
- documentation updates
- code shrinkage here and there
- coding style fixes
- removed all designated initializers from the header for better standards
  compliance

Bug fixes:
- fix the return value of gpiod_simple_event_loop()
- don't try to process docs if doxygen is not installed

libgpiod v0.1.3
===============

Bug fixes:
- this time the bug making it impossible to request both types of line events
  was really fixed
- pass the O_CLOEXEC flag to open() when opening the GPIO chip device file

libgpiod v0.1.2
===============

Bug fixes:
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h> in gpioset
- fix a formatting issue in gpioinfo for chips with >100 GPIO lines
- fix a bug when requesting both-edges event notifications

libgpiod v0.1.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- fix short options in gpiomon (short opt for --silent was missing)
- correct the kernel headers requirements in README
- include <time.h> for struct timespec
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h>
- detect the version of strerror_r()

libgpiod v0.1
=============

First version of libgpiod.

It's currently possible to:
- get and set the values of multiple GPIO lines with a single function call
- monitor a GPIO line for events
- enumerate all GPIO chips present in the system
- enumerate all GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- extract information about GPIO chips (label, name, number of lines)
- extract information about GPIO lines (name, flags, state, user)

Tools provided with the library are:
- gpioget - read values from GPIO lines
- gpioset - set values of GPIO lines
- gpiodetect - list GPIO chips
- gpioinfo - print info about GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- gpiomon - monitor a GPIO line for events
- gpiofind - find a GPIO line by name
